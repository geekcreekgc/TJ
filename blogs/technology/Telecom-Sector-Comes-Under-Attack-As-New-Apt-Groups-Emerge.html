      CyberEason has linked the attacking team with the Soft Cell APT team, which has operated since 2012 and has targeted communications providers in the same Southeast Asian region. Using threats on Microsoft Exchange servers, intimidating actors have been able to access the targeted network as they have compromised important network assets such as domain controllers (DCs) and payment systems with sensitive information such as call recording (CDR) data, which it acknowledges. to detect sensitive communications used by affected communication services. The report concluded that the attackers were adaptable, working to hide their activities, maintain persistence in infected programs, respond to preventative efforts and pass security measures until at least 2017 - an indication that targets have a high number of attackers.

      Filtered data is encrypted with password-protected data using the WinRAR tool and SoftEther VPN. A security company said the attacks were carried out in Reddelta, Mustang and Panda, based in China. Telemetry and forensic evidence suggest that the naming convention of tools and TTPs in the attack group is similar to Soft Cell, an APT team that has been operating since 2012 and had directed communications providers in the same Southeast Asian region before. research. The group's soft cell work is said to have been performed by a dangerous character and is believed to have helped China. Researchers Thomas Rocca, Thibault Seret and John Fokker of the security firm said the website was a malicious computer program that used similar tactics seen in groups such as RedDelta and Mustang Panda, reportedly based in China. New threat to LightBASIN liability companies in China Researchers are holding a series of attacks aimed at gathering important information. China's Advanced Persistent Threat Group has compromised the networks of telecommunications providers in Southeast Asia to steal sensitive communications from customers, according to a new report by security company Cybereason. CrowdStrike researchers found that the new LightBASIN group linked to China attacked 13 mobile phone companies worldwide in 2019. Like other Chinese cyber attacks, the group exploited the vulnerabilities of Microsoft Exchange servers. Chinese actors in the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) have targeted major telecommunications companies in the USA, Europe and Southeast Asia with cyber-espionage campaigns that appear to be designed to steal data related to 5G technology. Security companies Cybereason and Deadringer Research have highlighted attacks from China that use foreign corporate criminals to thwart multiple targets. Researchers have uncovered a number of unknown attacks that have been hacked and avoided by major suppliers since at least 2017, companies said.

      The Cyber-espionage campaign, which appears to be designed to steal data related to 5G technology, is promoting a ban on the use of Chinese technology in 5G deployment in several countries, McAfee said in a new report. According to McAfee, the Chinese actor Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) uses methods to subdue Mustang Panda Group a few security vendors identified as working for the Chinese government. Campaign-related information shows that victims are being lured into websites called Huawei workplaces, which are considered a leader in 5G. A study conducted in Bratislava (ESET) has revealed a new APT team, Backdoor Diplomacy, led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Middle East Africa and telecommunications companies. The attack began with the use of compromised internet applications and web servers to install a custom domain, ESET called itself Turian. The main tool used in the collection, according to Bitdefender, was the backdoor of the newly discovered Nebulae called Naikon APT Group. In most cases, attackers use nvsmarex.exe to load separate DLLs. They also use an unregistered keylogger called EnrollLoger to select high-profile assets that may receive sensitive information and access credentials from high-profile user accounts. As mentioned earlier, each collection has its own distinctive features that distinguish it from the rest of the group, but other collections can be identified in terms of victim research, timelines, archives and general tools, with a unique tool acquired after an unusual attack. The nebulae backdoor was reported in April 2021 and was included in the Naikon APT team. [Sources: 9] The first corruption was triggered by a password spray attack that resulted in the use of slapstick malware. The DLL Uploader was removed from encryption using the popular backdoor called PCShare, an online code that was reportedly used by Chinese online rebels in an attack on Southeast Asia, and the main download of nvsmartmax.dat was stored in the same directory . Operating since June, an invisible APT team called Harvester uses a custom backdoor called Graphon to collect screenshots and download other malware.

      Advanced Persistent Threat (AP) is a complex attack where one person or group accesses a network and stays undetected for a long time. This latest example demonstrates that APT teams use a full range of known and available intervention strategies to achieve results. Let's take a closer look at how intimidating APT actors work by exploring recent APT attacks, this time with DarkHydrus, a life-threatening end-of-life (APT) threat. Additional efforts and resources fall into the APT attack as cybercriminals choose high value targets such as regions of the country or large companies for the purpose of stealing information over the long term. The Advanced Direct Attack (ATA) method is not only used by certain sets and characters. Note that the att is intended
