CEO Osayi also confirmed that the next part of their next plan will be the expansion of new markets in telecommunications countries, Mpumalanga and South Africa. With this new loan, the launcher plans to expand its operations in East and South Africa.
           </p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">The startup will use the proceeds to invest in product development and continue its vertical and space growth, according to Verbit CEO and founder Tom Livne, adding that it will double its acquisition strategy. Verbit is one step closer to its planned IPO soon following the closure of Series E, Livne said when asked about its listing plan.</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">Livne said Verbit, which has strong influence in the UK and Australia, plans to expand to Europe, including Germany, France, Spain and other countries. Verbit serves more than 2,000 clients in the fields of news, education, business, law, and government. Both companies have grown into new units in the past few months, including grocery delivery. Zomato is the first Indian consumer online launcher to be listed on this wave.</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">The start of Indian food delivery announced last month that it had raised US $ 1.25 billion in a new funding round. Less than six months after raising $ 157 million in Series D, the Verbit, artificial intelligence and footnotes, announced today that it has terminated US $ 250 million in Series E funding and the company has -US $ 2 billion. Teesas, the founder of education technology, said it had completed an earlier US $ 1.6 million investment to close the gap between education and technology.</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">The start of Indian food delivery announced last month that it had raised US $ 1.25 billion in a new funding round. Less than six months after raising $ 157 million in Series D, the Verbit, artificial intelligence and footnotes, announced today that it has terminated US $ 250 million in Series E funding and the company has -US $ 2 billion. Teesas, the founder of education technology, said it had completed an earlier US $ 1.6 million investment to close the gap between education and technology.</p> 

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">
            Haresh Aswani, CEO of Tolaram Group Africa, led the Teesas round, which included Olivegreen Advisory Partners, an African-focused company, and other business angels. Teesas is now joining a growing list of African education technology starters who have recently received support from betting investors in the emerging African education technology technology industry, who have recently seen an increase driven by positive winds from the coronavirus epidemic. New characters in space include Kenya Kidato and Nigeria's Kreideland, Edukoya and Ulesson.
           </p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">Tessas will use new funding to expand new markets, launch a market that will connect students and faculty in the private sector, and expand its product range in its portfolio. Founded by Osayi Isedonmwen and launched in November 2021, Teesas presents itself as an African high school learning center with experimental materials from the best teachers in Africa. Teesas content is in line with the Nigerian national curriculum and is available to students live and recorded via an membership program starting at $ 6 per month.</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">In addition to the usual homework, the introduction offers courses for spoken language. According to Isedonmwen, students live with teachers in small, remote groups of 10-15 people to participate individually and with greater commitment to the educational process. In the near future, Teesas will offer complete learning modules for students up to 12 years of age.</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">Teesas also plans to introduce life skills courses in the first half of next year to prepare students to be able to study on their own. Teesas plans to introduce personal skills courses in the first half of next year to prepare students to discover for themselves. Teesas will soon be offering full curriculum modules for 12-year-olds. In the future, Teesas will provide complete study modules for students under 12 who will help them study long enough to prepare for entrance exams.</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">Teesa will have a significant impact on the future of education in Africa. The journey of reshaping education across the continent will be exciting and not without its unique challenges. The struggle for 20% of the world's population to become online readers overnight has ushered in a new era, the Digital Reading Age [Michael Moe and Vinyesh Rajendran].</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">The market capitalization of cryptocurrensets has increased by 16% from less than $ 135 billion yesterday to $ 162 billion today. Some of the same investors are hoping that bullish rates will slow down to give the industry time to gather some confidence.</p>

           <p class="py-4 px-24 text-xl text-yellow-200">Teesas currently has over 150,000 downloads in the Google Play Store and currently has a few.
