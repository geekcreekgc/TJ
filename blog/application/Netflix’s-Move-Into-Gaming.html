  <section class="text-white texxt-sm-start py-4">
    <div class="container">

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Netflix's move to gaming is a game changer as it reaffirms the work that developers have done to capture the views of billions of players around the world. Netflix's move to gaming is a game changer as it validates the work that developers have done so far to get the attention of billions of players around the world. Moving to Netflix games is a game changer for exploring the work that developers have done to earn an intellectual share of the billions of players around the world. As games continue to evolve, Netflix probably won't be the last tech giants to see online gaming as a potential source of income.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">While Netflix's foray into the gaming landscape is certainly a testament to the industry's appeal, others have raised concerns about what that might mean in the long run. The unprecedented move has been dubbed "a look at game developers around the world" by Aaron Simpson, president of Kindred for Business, a next-generation app monetization network. At first glance, this may seem like a blow to game developers, but it also opens up new possibilities.</p>

<img style="display: block;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 18cm;" src="https://c.files.bbci.co.uk/C56B/production/_119493505_gettyimages-1234061778-2.jpg" alt="image1">

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">As Netflix begins to conquer the gaming market (still a big assumption), developers will be encouraged to innovate to keep up with the pace of gaming. And there will always be developers trying to get rid of the limitations of modern gameplay. But with this power, there has always been hidden resistance, and part of the hope of a potential Netflix game acquisition is that there will always be an alternative.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">But for Netflix, regardless of strategy, the risk of entering the game world is still high. It is also interesting to measure the success of Netflix here, because many major entertainment companies have hesitated and lost the game to varying degrees. As far as the industry is concerned, I would like to know whether Netflix's strategy of using games to substantially support existing Netflix content marketing will be adopted by other brands. Netflix has found this foothold, which may have some impact in the next few years, but eventually the company's shift to games will further promote the game.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">As Microsoft seeks to expand its subscriber base with Xbox Game Pass, for example, it is offering great deals to developers and studios whose games it wants on the service. Look no further than the film and television business to see just how lucrative these deals can be: Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes has struck a $ 150 million deal with Netflix to produce content for the streaming giant.</p>

<img style="display: block;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 18cm;" src="https://sendbird.com/wp-content/uploads/20211102_Netflix-gaming-Blog-Cover-1.png" alt="image2">

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">This acquisition marks Netflix's first acquisition of a game studio, and this collaboration is largely due to the unparalleled canvas presented by the streaming media giant to its creators. This acquisition marks the beginning of a new era for Netflix, not just announcing that video games will be included in the Netflix subscription price. This move is Netflix's attempt to include video games as part of its standard subscription service. Netflix confirmed in July that it is expanding into the game field, starting with ad-free games for mobile devices such as phones and tablets. These games can be used for free on existing services and subscribers do not need to pay additional fees.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">In June 2018, Netflix announced a partnership with Telltale Games to provide its action-packed streaming video games. These games will be adapted into existing interactive narrative stories similar to those already provided by Netflix, and can be easily controlled by a TV remote.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The games will come bundled for free with Netflix's main app and are primarily intended to be played on mobile devices for now, although they may eventually make their way to TVs. The company thinks some of its games will be related in some way to Netflix-owned franchises - you can definitely imagine a Stranger Things game, albeit probably not from Sex / Life - but it may also license existing games and brands from others. developers.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">At a time when intellectual property is kept to a minimum to maximize value, developing games based on Netflix Originals makes a lot of sense for the company. The purchase of Night School and the further development of the Oxenfree franchise is an important step for Netflix, which now controls a studio suitable for making games with beloved characters with deep and emotionally resonating arcs.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Even before Netflix announced its intention to enter the gaming market, there was a lot of talk about the gaming ambitions of the streaming giants. For the first time, Netflix executives have detailed the company's vision for video games. Their reason for expanding the company's product offering was very ... Netflix. At first glance, Netflix will start offering mobile games to subscribers at no additional cost to add value to the service.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The shift to gaming is enabling Netflix to grow from the mainstream TV and film business to the world's largest video subscription service. Valve, which distributes Steam, was valued at $ 10-12 billion, and if Netflix launched its own version of Steam, it would have a lot of power to simply determine which games and developers would get top-notch real estate on their territory. Homepage. Yes, Netflix allows it, they really don't know anything about creating and hosting video games. But Netflix will be unique if it makes games part of its single subscription.</p>

<img style="display: block;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 18cm;" src="https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_13291630941.jpg" alt="image3">

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">This is even before we start discussing new and more disruptive products, such as Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass program or Apple's Arcade program, which provide a Netflix-style instant game library for monthly or annual subscriptions. Executives from major game studios and publishers told Business Insider that the rise of subscription services is a sign of a "new paradigm" in the industry, which may herald long-term challenges facing developers, even fans and platforms. In addition to Google, there are also serious discussions and speculations about other cloud services and video streaming companies entering the game industry. Amazon largely bypassed the game development path, turning to streaming media as a more viable alternative, and acquired Twitch in 2019.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">And Bloomberg reported last week that Netflix has hired an executive to launch its next gaming service. To kickstart this new adventure in the world of gaming, on July 14, Netflix selected Mike Verdu, most recently Facebook VP of Augmented and Virtual Reality, as its VP of Game Development. It's unclear when Netflix plans to launch its gaming service on iOS and iPadOS, but it will be interesting to see what the reception will be. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman revealed as part of his Power On newsletter that Netflix plans to release its mobile games for iOS individually through the App Store.</p>
