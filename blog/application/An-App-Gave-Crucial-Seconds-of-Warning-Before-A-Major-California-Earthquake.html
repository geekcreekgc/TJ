  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The quake posed a small threat to Pasadena, 250 km to the north, so ShakeAlert only warned of a small shock. The earthquake did not cause serious damage to the area, no one was killed.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The ShakeAlert system was first introduced in Los Angeles in 2018 and then expanded to California in 2019. The system was operational in Los Angeles when a 6.4 quake struck about 150 miles from the city, but it did not raise the alarm. When a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck 150 miles outside Los Angeles, the system did not sound an alarm because the shake projected onto the city was not powerful enough to pass the application's threshold.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Now, the scientists behind ShakeAlert can use the latest earthquake information to improve the system. Now, the scientists behind ShakeAlert can use the latest earthquake information to improve the system again. This event provided scientists and system operators with the opportunity to test and improve ShakeAlert to make it better during the next major earthquake.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The quake caused significant tremors but minimal damage in Humboldt County, about 210 miles northwest of San Francisco, and officials said it was an excellent test of the warning system. An earthquake in Humboldt County, about 210 miles northwest of San Francisco, caused strong tremors but little damage, and officials said it was a good test of the warning system. The best news about the earthquake is that no injuries were reported, although it was very severe.</p>

  <img style="display: block;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 18cm;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQrgLTTGdtJms3f1U_w46Era6eI=/0x255:3577x2128/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23124652/1176500948.jpg" alt="image1">

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">More than 4,300 people responded to the U.S. Geological Survey website located south of Monterey, north of Coos Bay, and from the coast to Lake Tahoe. The system went live last Monday and notified thousands of people a few seconds before we reminded them. According to Robert de Groot, ShakeAlert coordinator of the U.S. Geological Survey, people reported receiving a warning about 10 seconds before the shock began, making it a successful proof of concept for the system's first major earthquake. According to Robert de Groot, ShakeAlert coordinator of the U.S. Geological Survey, people reported receiving warnings about 10 seconds before the earthquake started. This is a successful test of the system during the first major earthquake.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">An early warning system operated by the US Geological Survey sent out warnings before the ground began to shake, giving residents of the sparsely populated area the time they needed to take cover. After the July 7.1 earthquake in Southern California's Ridgecrest, ShakeAlert issued an alarm in 7.4 seconds, which would provide early warning for residents more than 15 miles from epicenter. The earthquake Thursday night was strong enough to trigger smartphone warnings for Northern California residents. Alerts are part of a seismic warning system that is sent when earthquakes reach a magnitude of 4.5 or greater, and are intended to give people time to take cover. In California, ShakeAlert has been warning of impending earthquakes from nearby earthquakes for over three years to help cities, transportation systems, utilities, police departments and fire departments prepare.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">ShakeAlert sends alerts through many agencies and applications, including MyShakeApp, a publicly available wireless emergency alert system, and the Android operating system provided by Google. The system is a network of sensors that collects real-time information about the intensity, location and tremor of the West Coast earthquake and transmits it to distribution partners who send alerts via mobile phones and the Internet. The system consists of a series of sensors located on the coastline, which can detect the tremor of a strong earthquake and quickly determine its location and intensity. Earthquake early warning systems use seismic science and monitoring technology to alert equipment and personnel when flashing waves caused by earthquakes are expected to reach their locations.</p>

  <img style="display: block;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 18cm;" src="https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/750x500-ShakeAlert-App-2019.jpg" alt="image2">

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The ShakeAlert system does not predict an earthquake, but rather provides a warning that an earthquake has been detected nearby and alerts recipients that they might feel shaking. ShakeAlert calculates a preliminary value and then estimates how strong the shake will be at the user's location. If you are in an area where this level of excitement is expected, the system is designed to send you an alert in the MyShake app. Recent tests show that people receiving alert text messages in the Amber Alert-style wireless emergency alert system may receive a pre-shake alert, but it can also be too slow, providing a warning after the excitement has already begun.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The warning you receive depends on your proximity to the earthquake. Ferguson used the 1989 Loma Priet earthquake as an example to illustrate how the app reaches users.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Although the system will continue to evolve, there may be false alarms and missed earthquakes. If everything goes according to plan, the dense seismograph network in California, Oregon, and Washington will detect the first weak seismic wave and issue a quick warning of an impending earthquake.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The authorities will also begin issuing earthquake warnings through wireless emergency alert systems, and even provide Amber alert-style text messages to those who have not yet downloaded the app. Brian Ferguson, Deputy Director of Crisis Communications and Media Relations at the Governor's Office of Emergency Management, said these applications are expected to issue alerts faster than the WEA system. Earthquake-prone countries such as Mexico and Japan have a long history of earthquake early warning (EEW) systems, and warnings are usually sent via mobile phones or warning systems.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Since 2008, the USGS Earthquake Hazards program has supported earthquake early warning research and development in collaboration with California Institute of Technology, University of California at Berkeley and others to develop methods to rapidly detect earthquakes in the western United States for testing and improvement. using the California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN) to determine the network improvements that will be required to support a fully operational system and to prototype a system capable of providing early warnings to selected test users. After years of strong government and congressional support, we are pleased to see that the EEW system has made headway with about 70% of the seismic stations active and operational throughout the West Coast. Most important takeaway: We live in an earthquake-hit country and use this reminder to test how prepared you are.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Laurie Dengler is Professor Emeritus of Geology at Humboldt State University and an expert on tsunami and earthquake risks. California Earthquake Alert is the nation's first statewide public warning system that can give California residents decisive seconds to take cover before they feel shaky. California's MyShake Earthquake Alert System was released statewide in October 2019.</p>

  <p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">According to The Guardian, it slipped through half a million phones before a 6.2 magnitude quake struck northwest California, the largest earthquake since a system called ShakeAlert spread across the state. An early warning system designed to give people important warnings seconds before earthquakes deliver on Monday's promises. Scientists who developed ShakeAlert once promised that it could give early warning of strong and violent aftershocks from a distant earthquake.</p>
