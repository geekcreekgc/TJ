      <p3>CyberEason has linked a group of attacks to the Soft Cell APT group, which has been active since 2012 and targets telecommunications providers in the same region of Southeast Asia. Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers, threat actors were able to gain access to the target network from where they compromised critical network assets such as domain controllers (DC) and billing systems with sensitive information such as call details records (CDR) data, allowing them to access sensitive communications used by affected telecommunications services. The report concluded that the attackers were adaptable, worked to disguise their activities, maintain persistence on infected systems, respond to containment attempts and bypass security efforts until at least 2017 - an indication that the target is of great value for the attackers.</p3>

      <p3>
        Exfiltrated data was compressed with password-protected data using the WinRAR tool and the SoftEther VPN. The security firm said the attacks were attributed to Reddelta, Mustang and Panda, which are based in China. Telemetry and forensic evidence shows that the naming convention for tools and TTPs in a cluster of attacks is similar to that of Soft Cell, an APT group that has been in operation since 2012 and had targeted telecommunication providers in the same region of Southeast Asia in previous research. 
    
        The group's soft-cell activity has been attributed to a specific threat actor and is believed to be acting for Chinese state interests. Researchers Thomas Rocca, Thibault Seret and John Fokker of Security firm said in a blog post that the malware uses tactics similar to those seen in groups such as RedDelta and Mustang Panda, both of which are reportedly based in China. New threat to telecommunications companies by LightBASIN with ties to China Researchers are digging in a series of attacks aimed at gathering valuable information.
            
        China's Advanced Persistent Threat Group has compromised telecommunications providers' networks in Southeast Asia to steal sensitive communications from customers, according to a new report by security firm Cybereason. CrowdStrike researchers have found that the new China-linked LightBASIN group raided 13 telecoms companies worldwide in 2019. Like other Chinese cyber attacks, the group exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers. 
            
        Chinese actors in the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) targeted major telecommunications companies in the USA, Europe and Southeast Asia with cyber-espionage campaigns that appear to be designed to steal data related to 5G technology. Cyber security firms Cybereason and Deadringer Research have highlighted an attack trend emanating from China that uses third-party hackers to compromise multiple targets. Researchers have uncovered several unidentified cyber-attack campaigns that have infiltrated and evaded detection by major providers since at least 2017, the companies said.
             <br> <br> 
        <img class="img-1"  src="img\hand.jpg"> <br>
        The cyber-espionage campaign, which appears to be designed to steal data related to 5G technology is motivated by bans on the use of Chinese technology in 5G rollouts in several countries, said McAfee in a new report. According to McAfee, the Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor uses methods associated with the Mustang Panda Group that several security vendors have identified as working for the Chinese government. Data related to the campaign show that the victims were lured to websites purporting to be career sites for Huawei, which is considered a leader in 5G.
    
Research in Bratislava (ESET) has uncovered a new APT group, Backdoor Diplomacy, targeting foreign ministries in the Middle East and Africa as well as telecommunications companies. The attacks began by exploiting vulnerable Internet-exposed applications and web servers to install custom backdoors, which ESET called Turian. The main tool used in the cluster, according to Bitdefender, was the recently discovered Nebulae backdoor attributed to the Naikon APT Group. 
    
In most cases, the attackers use legitimate nvsmarex.exe side loaders and DLLs. They also use an undocumented keylogger called EnrollLoger to select high-profile assets that are likely to receive sensitive information and access credentials from highly privileged user accounts. As mentioned earlier, each cluster has its unique characteristics that separate it from another cluster, but some overlap can be observed in terms of victim research, timeframes, endpoints and generic tools, with a unique tool discovered in the wake of the attack being the rare nebulae backdoor reported in April 2021 and attributed to the Naikon APT group. [Sources: 9] 
    
The original compromise was made possible by a password spray attack that led to the use of slapstick malware. The loader DLL was decrypted using a known backdoor called PCShare, a code available online that was reportedly used by Chinese cyber-insurgents in attacks in Southeast Asian countries, and the core payload nvsmartmax.dat was stored in the same directory. Active since June, an invisible APT group called Harvester uses a custom backdoor called Graphon to collect screenshots and download other malware.

Advanced Persistent Threat (AP) is a sophisticated attack in which a person or group gains access to a network and stays undetected for an extended period of time. This latest example shows that APT groups use the full range of known and available intrusion techniques to achieve results. Let's take a closer look at how the APT threat actors operate by examining a recent APT attack, in this case by DarkHydrus, an advanced persistent threat group (APT).
    
A lot of effort and resources go into carrying out APT attacks as hackers select high-value targets such as nation states or large corporations with the intention of stealing information over a long period of time. The Advanced Targeted Attack (ATA) method is not only used by certain established groups and actors. Be aware that targeted attacks often begin by targeting websites or employees, not hardware or software.
    
It is commonplace for hackers and hacker groups in a targeted attack to create a viable means of communication so that their malicious code can fall in your network - in other words, they want to establish a permanent backdoor. This back door is crucial in ATA to issue orders and initiate later phases of the attack, such as asset discovery, exfiltration, and forensic cleanup.
    
Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are cyber attacks carried out by criminals or nation states with the intention of stealing data or monitoring a system over a long period of time. Attackers have a specific target, spend time and resources identifying vulnerabilities that they can exploit to gain access, and design an attack that goes undetected for a long time.
