<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">CEO Osayi also confirmed that the next part of their next plan will be to expand into new markets in francophone countries, East and South Africa. With this new loan, the startup plans to expand its operations in East and South Africa.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The startup will use the proceeds to invest in product development and continue its vertical and geographic expansion, according to Verbit CEO and founder Tom Livne, adding that it will also double down on its acquisition strategy. Verbit is one step closer to its planned IPO in the near future following the closure of Series E, Livne said when asked about its listing plan.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Livne said that Verbit, which has a strong influence in the UK and Australia, plans to further expand to Europe, including Germany, France, Spain and other countries. Verbit serves more than 2,000 clients in the media, education, corporate, legal, and government sectors. Both companies have expanded into new categories in the past few quarters, including grocery delivery. Zomato is the first Indian consumer Internet startup to be listed in this wave.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-red-700">An Indian food delivery startup announced last month that it had raised US$1.25 billion in a new round of financing. Less than six months after raising US$157 million in Series D financing, Verbit, an artificial intelligence-driven transcription and subtitling platform, announced today that it has completed a US$250 million Series E financing and the company is valued at US$2 billion. Teesas, an educational technology start-up, said it has completed an upfront investment of US$1.6 million to bridge the gap between education and technology.</p>

Less than six months after raising US$157 million in Series D financing, Verbit, an artificial intelligence-driven transcription and subtitling platform, announced today that it has completed a US$250 million Series E financing and the company is valued at US$2 billion. Teesas, an educational technology start-up, said it has completed an upfront investment of US$1.6 million to bridge the gap between education and technology.</p>


<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Haresh Aswani, CEO of Tolaram Group Africa, spearheaded the Teesas round, which included Olivegreen Advisory Partners, an Africa-focused venture capital firm, and other business angels. Teesas now joins a growing list of African education technology startups that have recently received funding from investors betting on the nascent African education technology industry, which has recently seen a surge fueled by favorable winds from the coronavirus pandemic. New actors in space include Kenya Kidato and Nigeria's Kreideland, Edukoya and Ulesson.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Tessas will use the new funding to expand into new markets, launch a market that will connect students with tutors for private lessons, and expand the range of products in its portfolio. Founded by Osayi Isedonmwen and launched in November 2021, Teesas is positioning itself as an African learning portal for top grades in exams with teaching materials from the best teachers in Africa. Teesas content is in line with Nigeria's national curriculum and is offered to students both live and recorded through the membership program starting at $ 6 per month.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">In addition to regular school activities, the startup offers spoken language lessons. According to Isedonmwen, students sit with teachers in small, remote classrooms of 10-15 people for individual participation and greater seriousness in the educational process. In the near future, Teesas will offer comprehensive study modules for students up to 12 years of age.</p>

<img style="display: block;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 18cm;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjJDAhplvFwTCCkXzKAAYSs3ZM8GvX7XYK_5w1BWM9jzbcqrmGn6sucIQshOwgtGqpgqvI7i6Et2nOmbEPnr58SdoccFSuJwlZIcEQEUXGT6SHGRqM2hEnOtAgpvWiW524aYwCH2RG8cnP0Sf_boDLCmjfkNgM7Gt1pfzzHj2WdTwYNN1_5vYpcz7AE=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu" alt="image2">

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Teesas also plans to introduce life skills courses in the first half of next year to prepare students for self-discovery. Teesas plans to launch personal skills courses in the first half of next year to prepare students for self-discovery. Teesas will soon offer comprehensive curriculum modules to 12-year-old students. In the future, Teesas will offer comprehensive study modules to students under 12 that will help them study long enough to be ready for the high school entrance exams.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Teesas will have a huge impact on the future of education in Africa. The journey to reshape education across the continent will be exciting and not without its unique challenges. The catalyst for 20% of the world's population to become online students overnight has ushered in a new era, the Age of Digital Learning [Michael Moe and Vinyesh Rajendran].</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has increased 16% from a low of $ 135 billion yesterday to $ 162 billion today. Some of the same investors are hoping that bullish valuations will decline slightly to give the sector time to gather some courage.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Teesas currently has over 150,000 downloads on the Google Play store and we currently have fewer. Teesas content is aligned with Nigeria's national curriculum and is available to students both live and recorded through a subscription program that starts at $ 6 per month.</p>


<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Osayi Isedonmwen, founder and CEO of Teesas, stated that the startup intends to expand its content to cover the entire K-6 curriculum, expand to Africa, create a tuition market and build a team. Izedonmwen plans to use this investment to enter new markets, launch a market, connect students with tutors in private courses, and expand the range of products in its product portfolio. Izedonmwen intends to use this investment to enter new markets, launch a market that connects students and teachers for private lessons, and expand its product portfolio. Tory Patterson, CEO of Owl Ventures, will also serve on uLesson's board of directors, further strengthening the commitment of education startups to use technology to provide affordable, high-quality, and affordable education throughout Africa.</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">He added that he will also start anti-bullying courses under the influence of a wave of bullying in Nigeria. TikTok has worked with other social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube to develop guidelines to help moderators deal with child abuse and other traumatic images. A company that provides content reviewers for large technology companies even admitted in a consent form that work can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>

<p class="py-3 text-xl text-blue-300">Work on Teesas began last March with the design and development of a platform that the company borrowed heavily from its Indian teaching technology colleagues and used as a guide for content structure and distribution lesson. After seven years of manufacturing electronic gadgets under the leadership of his company Imose Technologies, Osayi Isedonmwen took time off to explore an idea he had been playing with for a while: Teesas, a startup that now offers video tutorials and more. material for students from Nigeria. Tesla is one of the newest car brands with its first car, the Roadster, launched in 2008. Since then, with the release of Model S, X, and now 3, he has become a popular icon to be mentioned in 142 songs.</p>
