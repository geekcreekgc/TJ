                The company will be called Facebook, according to the New York Times. It's the end of an era. While it's
                widely known as the company behind the popular social network, Facebook will be known simply as
                Facebook. The company said in a statement that it would be replacing its long-standing name, which means
                a lot. <br> <br>

                    *Q: What is a "proxy" or "proxy vote"? <br> <br>

                    A: A proxy vote is a vote for one of the nominated directors or nominees at a company's annual meeting. This is often used for institutional investors who wish to express their support for the proposed candidates to make sure that they win election to the board. Proxy votes are not a vote for or against the management's views. Rather, they are one way of making sure that management is held accountable for its actions and to encourage board renewal.
                    
                    Q: Why do we have proxy fights? <br> <br>
                    
                    A: Proxy fights are a way for shareholders to achieve what is called "say on pay" or "say on proposal" or "say on agenda item" or "say on proposal (SFUP)." In other words, the shareholder forces the CEO and management to explain its position on an important issue to the shareholders. It can also have the effect of encouraging the board and management to improve its corporate governance practices. <br> <br>
                    
                    *Q: What is a shareholder proposal? <br> <br>
                    
                    A: A shareholder proposal is a document written by a shareholder which describes the issues that it would like to see addressed by the company and its management. They are often non-financial in nature, but are as well focused on the company's growth strategies or the compensation that the company pays to executives. If the shareholder receives at least three percent of the outstanding shares of the company, the board must hold a vote to consider and vote on the proposal. <br> <br>
                    
                    Q: How is the proposal voted? <br> <br>
                    
                    A: If the shareholders are opposed to the proposal, the proposal fails. If the shareholders approve the proposal, then the proposal goes to a vote of the board and the board makes a decision whether or not to put the proposal to a vote of the shareholders. Often, companies put the shareholder proposals to a vote but they are frequently voted down. The reason for this is that the shareholders are often controlled by a small number of institutional investors who often vote against proposals they oppose. So in this way, the institution owned by a few shareholders can have a large effect on shareholder voting. <br> <br>
                    
                    *Q: What is a "say on pay" or "say on proposal"? <br> <br>
                    
                    A: In the case of a say on pay or a say on proposal, if a company does not act or act in a manner that the shareholders believe is proper, the shareholders can vote to rescind that pay or plan. In other words, the shareholders can ask the board of directors and the company to "say on it." The most common example of this type of proposal is the annual meeting, which is a forum in which shareholders ask the board of directors to say on what they do. Say on pay and say on proposal are put on the ballot because shareholders are dissatisfied with the way the company has acted. <br> <br>
                    
                    *Q: How are shareholder proposals put on the ballot? <br> <br>
                    
                    A: Once a shareholder proposal has received at least three percent of the outstanding shares of the company, the management must make a decision whether or not to put the proposal to a vote of the shareholders. So, for example, in the case of a say on pay, if the board of directors finds that the request is to affect the amount of the CEO's pay, it must make the decision whether or not to put the say on pay resolution to a vote of the shareholders. If the board agrees to put the proposal to a vote of shareholders, then the vote must be held and the results of that vote is published in the company's proxy statement. <br> <br>
                    
                    *Q: Why do we vote by proxy? <br> <br>
                    
                    A: Typically, institutional investors like mutual funds and other institutions (other than your direct descendants) will vote by proxy in order to reduce costs. Moreover, it allows them to vote their shares on a date that is convenient for them. So if they are in the United States or Canada, they can make their proxy vote at a time that works best for them. However, if they are not in the United States or Canada, they must vote by mail. <br> <br>
